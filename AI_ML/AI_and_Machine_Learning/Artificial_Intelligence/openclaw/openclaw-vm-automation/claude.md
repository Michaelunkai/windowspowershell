# Claude Rules
## Rule 1

PowerShell v5 syntax - use semicolons (;) not double-ampersand (&&) for command chaining

## Rule 2

Use mcp-ondemand.ps1 for dynamic MCP server loading - verify servers with mcps command and run mcp-on or mcp-off to use the mcps that you need for the tasks

## Rule 3

always read all md files in the folder!

## Rule 4

100% autonomous operation - background tasks auto-run without prompts, complete tasks fully with test verification

## Rule 5

Fix root causes, not symptoms - trace dependencies before edits, never suppress errors with as any or @ts-ignore

## Rule 6

Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones - never write new files unless explicitly requested

## Rule 7

Run lsp_diagnostics on all changed files before completion

## Rule 8

Verify with tests before marking any task complete - ensure all tests pass

## Rule 9

Real-time progress updates - mark [x] on completion of each step

## Rule 10

Log all errors to .claude/learned.md for future reference

## Rule 11

Clean up ONLY when the user explicitly says the task is done - do NOT auto-cleanup or auto-exit mid-work. Never stop working until ALL steps are complete and verified.

## Rule 12

Document all changes and fixes - update/create agents.md or architecture.md on infrastructure changes

## Rule 13

Create clear, descriptive commit messages when explicitly requested

## Rule 14

NEVER exit interactive mode or stop working until the user explicitly tells you to stop. Keep working on the task until fully complete. The Stop hook in settings.json is configured - override with: `New-Item -Path "$env:TEMP\claude_task_complete" -Force`

## Rule 15

NEVER use `run_in_background: true` in Agent tool calls. Background task IDs are session-scoped â€” they die when the session ends or when multiple sessions are open. Using them across sessions causes "No task found" errors and ENOENT API socket failures. Always use foreground agents (no run_in_background parameter).

## Rule 16

NEVER call TaskOutput or TaskGet with IDs from previous sessions or from other concurrent sessions. Task IDs only live for the duration of the session that created them. If TaskOutput returns "No task found", do NOT retry â€” the task is permanently gone. Use foreground Agent calls instead.
